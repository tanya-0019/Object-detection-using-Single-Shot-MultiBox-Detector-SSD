# Object-detection-using-Single-Shot-MultiBox-Detector-SSD
In this project, different objects from a video file are detected using a pre-trained SSD file that contains the weights of the SSD neural network . The torch library (PyTorch) is used for computing efficiently the gradients of composition functions in backward propagation. Imageio library is used for processing the images of the video.
